# Rewire Stroke app

This is Version 1 of Rewire Stroke â€“ an app that functions as a stroke survivor's personal physiotherapist.

The project aims to use MVVM design pattern where it makes sense to, and SwiftUI in certain parts of the app. The backend of choice is Google Firebase, where user data is stored and workout videos available for download when the app is deployed in the future. Currently, the project assumes that the videos are stored on the device / simulator. This is just for the testing phase where we demonstrate proof of concept.

UI / UX design to be revamped within the next 2 months.

So far:

The user signs up, and navigates to the Activity page. They can select Upper Limb Assessment and complete a video-guided assessment which then generates a workout programme based on their selection. The user can now complete workout videos. 
In addition, there are a some information pages for the user to digest.
